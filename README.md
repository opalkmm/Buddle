# Buddle 

Buddle (buddy + huddle) originated from my wish to have a group of people who share a niche interest to share new information, show their collection, etc. The feed allows people to see photo feed and description of people within the group, with the ability to 'like' and 'comment'. Most of the times, the group functionality of major social media is cluttered with texts and irrelevant information. This application will show only photos and the users will have more controll over what they would like to see.

# Built with:
- ReactJS
- Javascript
- Material UI
- HTML
- CSS
- test: mocha, chai

# How to run

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Success! Created buddle at /Users/Alex/Documents/OpalandAlex/Buddle/buddle
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn start
    Starts the development server.

  yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

  yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd buddle
  yarn start
--              --              --              --
